# satRdays.org site generator
This repo is used for holding the items needed to generate a static site via [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

The core site repo is a user-level repo so the site HTML has to be stored in master. As such, this repo is used to store the source code and it can used to generate a `public` folder. The contents of which should be pushed to the satrdays.github.io repo.
