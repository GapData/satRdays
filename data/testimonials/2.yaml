text: "Running the Hungarian R User Group was always such a good and rewarding experience, so it wasn't a question at all if I'm willing to help with the baby steps of the project and kicking off the first satRday conference. It was quite a lot of work, but the almost 200 registrations from 19 countries and 25 awesome speakers providing 12+ hours of fun and educating experience in a good company totally worthed it!"
